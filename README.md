# AWS IAM Automation with CloudFormation & GitHub Actions

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to automate the setup of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users, roles, and policies using CloudFormation templates, with deployments automated through GitHub Actions. By using these configurations, you can improve your cloud security and streamline the process of managing IAM permissions.

The project highlights best practices for managing IAM roles, enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA), and automating IAM role assignments for developers in a cloud-native application environment.

## Key Features

- **Automated IAM User Setup**: Easily create IAM users and groups with predefined permissions.
- **CloudFormation Templates**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for defining IAM roles, policies, and MFA enforcement.
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automate the deployment of CloudFormation templates through a CI/CD pipeline triggered by repository updates.
- **Best Practices**: Implements security best practices, such as the principle of least privilege and mandatory MFA.

## Project Structure

- **IAMUserSetup.yml**: CloudFormation template to automate the creation of IAM users and groups, apply policies, and enforce MFA.
- **.github/workflows/deploy.yml**: GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment of the CloudFormation stack upon code changes.
- **docs/**: Additional documentation on configuring AWS IAM for security and automation.

## How It Works

1. **CloudFormation Template**: 
   - The template creates an IAM user with read-only access to S3, adds them to an IAM group, and enforces MFA.
   
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: 
   - Automatically deploys the CloudFormation template upon each push to the `main` branch. 
   - AWS credentials are configured using GitHub Secrets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: Ensure you have access to an AWS account where you have permissions to deploy IAM resources.
- **GitHub Repository**: Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
- **GitHub Secrets**: Store your AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

### Steps to Deploy:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-iam-automation-with-cloudformation.git
   cd aws-iam-automation-with-cloudformation
